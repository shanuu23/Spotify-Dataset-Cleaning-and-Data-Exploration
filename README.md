# ðŸŽ§ Spotify-Dataset-Cleaning-and-Data-Exploration

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a Spotify dataset to uncover insights about track,genre, and playlists popularity.

What I Did:
    Cleaned the dataset: removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
    Ensured each track appears in only one playlist to avoid duplication in analysis.

Identified:
    1) Top 5 playlists by average track popularity.
    2) Most popular genre and subgenre in each playlist.
    3) Top song (with artist and popularity score) from each playlistâ€™s top subgenre.
    4) Albums with the most hit tracks by count.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations:
1)Created bar charts and other plots to visualize:
    a) Track popularity across top playlists.
    b) Genre and subgenre distributions.

ðŸ“Œ Future Work:
    1) More in-depth audio feature analysis (e.g., tempo, danceability).
    2) Cluster analysis to group similar playlists or tracks.
    3) Interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit.
